# extend-layer

This is an autohotkey script which adds a layer to my keyboard,
which is a standard small sized norwegian keyboard.

The script changes a lot of keybindings when caps lock is activated, these new keys are 
used to navigate, manipulate text, and more. It replaces the need to move your fingers off the home row and either 
use the mouse, or the arrow keys. The layer of keys are as centralised as possible.

If you want to use this script yourself, but have a different keyboard layout, just edit the script to fit your own 
keyboard.

If you want to also see my key layout for the layer visually, open my repository named "extend-layer-ghost-keyboard".
This script shows which keys of the new layer do what, and where they are placed.
